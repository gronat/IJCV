  annote = {Google Maps API combined with Street View images can serve
as a powerful tool for place recognition or city reconstruction tasks.
In this paper, we present a way how to build geotagged datasets of
perspective views from Google Maps. Given the initial GPS coordi-
nates, the algorithm can build a list of panoramas in a certain area,
download corresponding panoramas, and generate perspective views.
In more detail, each panorama on Google Maps Street View contains
meta data from which the GPS location and the direction of the view
can be extracted. Moreover, the information about the neighbouring
panoramas can be obtained as well, hence, a list of panoramas cov-
ering a certain area can be built. Downloading panoramas from the
list and combining it with the meta data, each downloaded panorama
is cut into a set of overlaping perspective views and stored while the
camera GPS location, yaw, and pitch are coded in the filename of the
perspective view. The geotagged database is subsequently used for
place recognition and structure from motion 3D reconstruction.},

    abstract = {{We propose an approximate nearest neighbor search method based on product quantization, which decomposes the space into a Cartesian product of low dimensional subspaces and quantizes each subspace separately. A vector is represented by a short code corresponding to the quantization index. The Euclidean distance between two vectors can be efficiently estimated from their codes. Our method has an advantageous asymmetric version, where an estimated distance is computed between a vector and a code. Our approach is used to search for nearest neighbors efficiently, in particular in combination with an inverted file system. Experiments performed on SIFT and GIST image descriptors show excellent search accuracy outperforming three state-of-the-art approaches. The scalability of our approach is validated on a dataset of two billion vectors.}},
